In the first part, you will implement the functions
1. Hangman.score_guess/2 
    - takes a tuple representing (
        * state of a game : four elements: secret word, currect_guesses, wrong_guesses, remaining_turns) 
        * a letter (the player’s guess) 
    - returns the state of the game after taking into account the guess.
===> git add -A && git commit -m "Hangman.score_guess implemented"

2. Hangman.format_feedback/1 
    - that takes a tuple representing the state of a game 
        * generates the string with the feedback for the player (e.g. “-a—a-”).
===> git add -A && git commit -m "Hangman.format_feedback implemented, END OF PART I"
-----------------------------------------------

In the second part, you will implement test cases to ensure 
1. the coverage of all lines in the the implementation of GenServer-based Elixir process 
    (which I am providing you as input) that handles the state of a game.
===> git add -A && git commit -m "test cases of GenServer-based, END OF PART II"
------------------------------------------------

Finally, in the third part, you will implement test cases 
1. to ensure the coverage of all lines in the implementation of a REST wrapper 
    for our hangman game. Such wrapper could be used, for instance, in implementing 
    a nice looking web frontend application (the latter is out of scope of the homework though).
===> git add -A && git commit -m "test cases of REST wrapper, END OF PART III"
